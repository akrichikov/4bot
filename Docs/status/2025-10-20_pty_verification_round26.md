## Input Analysis
- Triads (pwd, ls, tree) at root and subfolders.
- Strong scans excluding `submodules/` for PTY primitives, classes, static refs.
- Runtime provenance verified for core PTY symbols.

## Verification Results
- No PTY primitives/classes/daemon implementations found in 4bot.
- `VTerm`, `VTermHTTPServer`, `client_request` resolve to `ptyterm.*`.
- `xbot/static` remains absent; static assets are in `ptyterm/static`.

## Conclusion
- PTY implementation remains fully centralized in pty repo. 4bot stays clean (Round 26).
