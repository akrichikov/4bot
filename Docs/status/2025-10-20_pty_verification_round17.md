## Input Analysis
- Triads executed with `pwd`, `ls`, and `tree` at root and subfolders.
- Strong ripgrep scans excluding `submodules/` for PTY primitives, classes, static refs.
- Runtime provenance rechecked for `VTerm`, `VTermHTTPServer`, `client_request`.

## Verification Results
- No PTY primitives/classes/daemon implementations present in 4bot code.
- Runtime symbols resolve to `ptyterm.*` modules.
- `xbot/static` is absent; assets are served from `ptyterm/static`.

## Conclusion
- PTY implementation remains fully centralized in pty repo. 4bot is clean (Round 17).
