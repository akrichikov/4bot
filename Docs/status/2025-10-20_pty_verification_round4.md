## Input Analysis
- Executed `pwd && ls -la` and `tree -a -L 2` at repo root.
- Performed deep ripgrep scans excluding `submodules/` for PTY primitives and server/daemon symbols.

## Verification Results
- No PTY implementation (pty/termios/tty/openpty/TIOCSWINSZ) is present in 4bot outside `submodules/ptyterm/ptyterm/*`.
- No classes `VTerm` / `VTermHTTPServer` or `client_request` / `DEFAULT_SOCKET` are defined in 4bot code.
- The only PTY references are import re-exports in `xbot/vterm*.py` and consumer code.
- `xbot/static/` is absent (assets live in `ptyterm/static` only).

## Conclusion
- 4bot contains no PTY implementation. Single source is the pty repo.
