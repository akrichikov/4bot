## Input Analysis
- Triads executed at root and key subfolders.
- Strong scans excluding `submodules/` for PTY primitives and class/server/daemon markers.
- Runtime provenance check for `VTerm`, `VTermHTTPServer`, `client_request`.

## Verification Results
- No PTY primitives or class implementations found in 4bot.
- Runtime symbols resolve to `ptyterm.*` modules.
- No `xbot/static` directory; assets live in `ptyterm/static`.

## Conclusion
- PTY implementation is fully externalized to pty repo. 4bot remains clean (Round 11).
