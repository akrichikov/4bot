## Input Analysis
- Triads executed at root and subfolders using pwd, ls, and tree.
- Scans exclude `submodules/` for PTY primitives, class markers, and static refs.
- Runtime provenance for `VTerm`, `VTermHTTPServer`, and `client_request`.

## Verification Results
- No PTY primitives/classes/daemon definitions found in 4bot.
- Runtime symbols resolve to `ptyterm.*` modules.
- `xbot/static` remains absent; assets live in `ptyterm/static`.

## Conclusion
- PTY implementation is fully externalized to pty repo. 4bot remains clean (Round 13).
