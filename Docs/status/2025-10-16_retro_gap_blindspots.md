# 2025-10-16 — Repo Scan, Tests, Retro/Gap/Blind‑Spot Analysis

## Input Analysis
- Goal: Browser-based X (Twitter) account manager (API facade replacement) with Playwright.
- Scope: Scan repository, execute tests, analyze Docs, surface gaps/blind spots, and propose fixes.

## Command Outputs (Summary)
- pwd: `/Users/doctordre/projects/4bot`
- ls: root contains `xbot/`, `tests/`, `Docs/`, CLI and helper scripts, auth/profile assets.
- t: not found (non-standard helper).
- tree (top-level): 33 dirs, 93 files. Key dirs: `xbot/`, `tests/`, `Docs/`, `chrome_profiles/`, `auth_data/`.

## Identified Paths (Key Components)
- Core library: `xbot/` (facade, browser/session, flows, selectors, waits, health, results, telemetry, CLI).
- CLI entry: `xbot/cli.py` (Typer app `xbot`).
- Tests: `tests/` (+ some ad‑hoc top-level interactive scripts).
- Docs: `Docs/` and `Docs/status/`.
- Profiles/session artifacts: `auth_data/`, `chrome_profiles/`, `config/profiles`.

## Test Execution
- venv: `.venv` active (Python 3.14.0).
- Installed runtime deps: playwright, pydantic, python-dotenv, typer, rich, tenacity, pyotp, aiohttp, pycryptodome.
- Installed browser: `python -m playwright install chromium`.
- Collect-only: 6 tests collected (all within `tests/` + one interactive module).
- Full run: 1 skipped (interactive browser demo), remaining tests passed: `s....`.

## Retro (What’s Working)
- Clear layered design: `XBot` facade composes flows, waits, selectors, rate limiting, telemetry, and results logging.
- Idempotent action patterns (e.g., like/retweet check before act) and confirmation gates for posts/replies.
- CLI covers login/session, cookies import/export, playbooks, health, scheduling, reporting, and profiles.
- Test suite sanity-checks schemas, profiles, and import health; fast and deterministic.

## Gaps (Observed)
- Packaging: `pyproject.toml` lacked build-system and package discovery; `pip install -e .` failed. Added setuptools config with `include = ["xbot*"]`.
- Missing dependency: tests import `Crypto` (pycryptodome) but it wasn’t declared. Added `pycryptodome>=3.18` to `[project.dependencies]`.
- Test stability: `browser_cookie_test.py` is an interactive, infinite-loop browser demo named as a pytest test; it hung the run. Marked module to skip under pytest, preserving manual execution.
- Install step: Playwright browsers not provisioned by default. Ensured `python -m playwright install chromium` requirement.
- Env defaults: relies on local cookies/artifacts; CI pathing/envs not fully documented for headless-live vs offline runs.

## Blind Spots (Risk Areas)
- UI drift: selectors may break; need automated drift snapshots and evaluation gates (some present in health; enforce in CI).
- Login heuristics: changes to auth flows/2FA or risk challenge can bypass current checks; add fallbacks and telemetry.
- Anti-bot defenses: headless fingerprints, rate spikes, and scroll behavior patterns; tune humanization, proxy rotation, and cooldowns.
- Content confirmation: reliance on timeline/profile scans can miss delayed propagation; add robust status ID extraction fallbacks and backoff.
- Session integrity: cookie vs storage-state consistency across profiles; clear migration/refresh rules.
- Concurrency: multiple actions racing on one context/profile; guard with locks/session-per-action.
- Packaging/installation: editable installs and optional extras for health/reporting to simplify onboarding and CI.

## Fixes Applied (This Pass)
- browser_cookie_test.py: skip during pytest (interactive-only) to prevent hangs.
- pyproject.toml: added `pycryptodome` dependency; added build-system + setuptools discovery (include `xbot*`).
- Test run: all tests pass (`5 passed, 1 skipped`).

## Recommendations (Prioritized)
1. CI health gate
   - Add job that runs: `ruff`, `black --check`, `pytest -q` (exclude `live`), and `python -m playwright install chromium`.
   - Accept: CI green required; drift snapshot check executes.
2. Selector drift automation
   - Ensure `xbot.health` snapshots + evaluation run nightly and on PRs; emit artifacts under `Docs/status/`.
   - Accept: Fail build when drift score > threshold.
3. Live test lane (opt-in)
   - Mark any browser-hitting tests with `@pytest.mark.live`; configure `-m "not live"` in CI; document env vars.
   - Accept: Live lane passes locally with valid creds and cookies.
4. Session policy
   - Document/implement rotation and refresh cadence for `storageState` vs cookie JSON; integrity checks + re-login fallback.
   - Accept: deterministic restore across profiles; corruption auto-heals via login flow.
5. Packaging polish
   - Provide `extras` groups: `health`, `report`, `dev`; verify `pip install -e .[dev]` works.
   - Accept: editable install succeeds; CLI `xbot` available.
6. Anti-bot hardening
   - Expand UA/args, navigator tuning, input jitter, viewport variability, and scroll cadence; add proxy pool hooks.
   - Accept: lower challenge frequency in pilot runs; no regressions.

## Validation Steps
- `pytest -q` → 5 passed, 1 skipped (interactive).
- `python -m playwright install chromium` succeeds locally.
- `xbot --help` prints Typer command tree.

## Violation Absence Confirmation
- No backups created; no `/tmp` usage; no duplicates introduced; all changes in-place within tree-mapped paths.

## Next Steps
- Wire CI job per recommendations.
- Add drift snapshot/eval invocation to CI and generate daily status in `Docs/status/`.
- Convert any remaining interactive demos to `scripts/` or mark as `live`.
