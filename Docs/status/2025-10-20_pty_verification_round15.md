## Input Analysis
- Triads executed with `pwd`, `ls`, and `tree` at root and subfolders (`xbot/`, `apps/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`).
- Strong ripgrep scans excluding `submodules/` for PTY primitives/classes and static asset references.
- Runtime provenance for `VTerm`, `VTermHTTPServer`, and `client_request`.

## Verification Results
- No PTY primitives/classes/daemon implementations present in 4bot code.
- Runtime symbols resolve to `ptyterm.*` modules.
- No `xbot/static`; assets served from `ptyterm/static`.

## Conclusion
- PTY implementation remains fully externalized to pty repo. 4bot stays clean (Round 15).
