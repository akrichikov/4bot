## Input Analysis
- Triads executed at root and key subfolders.
- Strong scans excluding `submodules/` for PTY primitives, class markers, and static asset references.

## Verification Results
- No PTY primitives or class implementations in 4bot.
- No static asset references to `xbot/static`; assets are in `ptyterm/static` only.
- Re-export stubs remain; no local implementations.

## Conclusion
- PTY implementation remains fully externalized to the pty repo (Round 8).
