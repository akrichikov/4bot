# Initial Due Diligence and Repo Mapping (Oct 16, 2025)

## Command Outputs (summarized)

- `pwd`: `/Users/doctordre/projects/4bot`
- `ls -la` (root): `.env`, `.gitignore`, `Docs/`, `.git/`
- `tree -a -I '.git'`:
  - `./.env` (contains secrets — redacted in this report)
  - `./.gitignore`
  - `./Docs/GitHub X Automation Browser Wrappers.md`
  - 2 directories, 3 files total

## Identified Paths (single source of truth)

- Root files:
  - `.env` (contains `x_user`, `x_passwd` — treat as sensitive)
  - `.gitignore`
- Docs:
  - `Docs/GitHub X Automation Browser Wrappers.md`
  - `Docs/status/` (created by this analysis)

## Test Discovery and Execution

- `pytest --collect-only`: no tests collected (exit code 5)
- `pytest`: not executed (no tests present)

## Forensic Notes and Blind Spots

- No application code detected; repository currently documentation + env only.
- Presence of plaintext credentials in `.env`. Immediate recommendation: rotate credentials and store secrets securely (e.g., 1Password, env var injection at runtime). Do not commit `.env` to VCS.
- No `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, or `Dockerfile` found; build and runtime stack undefined.

## Violations Check (required guarantees)

- No backups created.
- No use of `/tmp/**` paths.
- No duplicates introduced; all operations confined to tree-mapped paths.

## Clarification Required

1) Target stack: Python (Playwright/Selenium), Node (Playwright/Puppeteer), or other?
2) Scope: scaffold automation framework now vs. await spec? The Docs suggest GitHub↔X browser automation wrappers; confirm priority use cases (login via cookies, posting, scraping, replies, etc.).
3) Secret handling: approve removal of committed `.env` and addition of a sample `.env.example`? Also confirm credential rotation.
4) Testing: approve adding an integration test harness (no mocks) and CI workflow? If yes, specify which live accounts and rate limits to respect.

## Next Proposed Steps (pending approval)

- Create minimal project scaffold (`src/`, `tests/`, `config/`) with chosen stack.
- Add typed config loader and secret injection; provide `.env.example`.
- Implement cookie-based login bootstrap and session persistence.
- Establish lint/format/test tooling and CI; add initial integration test placeholders.
