## Input Analysis
- Triads executed with `pwd`, `ls`, and `tree` at root and subfolders.
- Strong scans excluding `submodules/` for PTY primitives/classes and static references.
- Runtime provenance verified for `VTerm`, `VTermHTTPServer`, and `client_request`.

## Verification Results
- No PTY primitives/classes/daemon implementations found in 4bot code.
- Runtime symbols resolve to `ptyterm.*` modules.
- `xbot/static` remains absent; static assets reside in `ptyterm/static`.

## Conclusion
- PTY implementation remains fully centralized in the pty repo. 4bot is clean (Round 20).
