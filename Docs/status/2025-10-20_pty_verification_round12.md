## Input Analysis
- Triads at root and key subfolders.
- Strong scans excluding `submodules/` for PTY primitives, classes, and static references.
- Runtime provenance for `VTerm`, `VTermHTTPServer`, `client_request`.

## Verification Results
- No PTY primitives/classes/daemon definitions in 4bot.
- Runtime symbols continue to resolve to `ptyterm.*`.
- `xbot/static` remains absent; assets are served from `ptyterm/static`.

## Conclusion
- PTY implementation remains fully centralized in pty repo. 4bot is clean (Round 12).
