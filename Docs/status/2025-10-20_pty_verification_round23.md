## Input Analysis
- Triads (pwd, ls, tree) at root and subfolders.
- Strong scans excluding `submodules/` for PTY primitives/classes and static refs.
- Runtime provenance verified for core PTY symbols.

## Verification Results
- No PTY primitives/classes/daemon implementations in 4bot code.
- `VTerm`, `VTermHTTPServer`, `client_request` resolve to `ptyterm.*`.
- `xbot/static` remains absent; static assets in `ptyterm/static`.

## Conclusion
- PTY implementation remains fully centralized in the pty repo. 4bot is clean (Round 23).
