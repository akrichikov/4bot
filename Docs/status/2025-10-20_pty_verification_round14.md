## Input Analysis
- Ran triads (pwd, ls, tree) at root and key subfolders.
- Executed strong ripgrep scans excluding `submodules/` for PTY primitives and class/server/daemon markers.
- Checked runtime provenance for `VTerm`, `VTermHTTPServer`, and `client_request`.

## Verification Results
- No PTY primitives or class/daemon/server implementations in 4bot.
- Runtime symbols resolve to `ptyterm.*` modules.
- No `xbot/static`; assets live in `ptyterm/static`.

## Conclusion
- PTY implementation remains fully externalized in the pty repo. 4bot is clean (Round 14).
