# 2025-10-18 Repo Scan and Test Run

## Command Outputs

- CWD: `/Users/doctordre/projects/4bot`
- Root listing: `.env, .git, .venv, apps, artifacts, auth, auth_data, bin, config, Docs, logs, playbooks, prompts, scripts, tests, xbot, ...`
- Tree summary (depth=2): 67 directories, 197 files; `tree` available.

## Identified Paths

- Code: `xbot/` (core package), `apps/cz/` (entrypoints), `bin/` (scripts)
- Tests: `tests/` (unit/integration, pytest config in `pyproject.toml`)
- Docs: `Docs/status/` (status reports)

## Test Execution

- Environment: local venv `.venv` activated
- Install: `pip install -e .[dev]` completed successfully
- Pytest collect-only: all tests collected without import errors
- Full pytest: 1 skipped (live), all others passed (no errors, no failures)

```
pytest result: s................................................................ [100%]
```

## Policy/Constraints Compliance

- No backups created; no duplicates introduced
- No `/tmp` used; operations confined to repo paths
- In-place only: no existing files altered during this scan; added this status file

## Post-Verification

- `git status` shows only this new file under `Docs/status/`

## Notes

- Tree output exceeds CLI line cap; full per-dir inspection performed via targeted listings. Key directories enumerated above.
