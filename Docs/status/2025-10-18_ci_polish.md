Title: CI Polish – Pages Artifact + Health Report
Date: 2025-10-18

Summary
- CI now generates a system health JSON (best-effort) and uploads Docs/status as an artifact named xbot-reports for GitHub Pages deployment.
- Playwright deps install added to CI for environments that need it.

Jobs
- lint: ruff and black checks.
- test: installs deps, installs Playwright chromium + deps, runs pytest (non-live), runs make system-health (best-effort), uploads Docs/status as xbot-reports.

Pages
- pages.yml already deploys the xbot-reports artifact; this connects CI → Pages.
