## Input Analysis
- Executed `pwd && ls -la` and `tree -a -L 2` at repo root.
- Repeated the same triad in `xbot/`, `apps/`, `scripts/`, and `tests/`.
- Performed ripgrep scans excluding `submodules/` for PTY primitives and in-memory terminal methods.

## Verification Results
- No direct PTY implementation found in 4bot outside `submodules/ptyterm/ptyterm/*`.
- `xbot/vterm*.py` remain re-export stubs only; no classes or PTY calls.
- `apps/` and `scripts/` reference VTerm via stubs or the local HTTP client class; no PTY primitives.

## Conclusion
- PTY implementation continues to be fully centralized in the pty repo.
- 4bot is clean: re-exports and integrations only; zero duplicates, no backups, no `/tmp` use.
