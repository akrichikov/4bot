map the repo and re-imagine folder files hierarchy make it several levels deep and move / group the files where they below, without integration issues.... update all affected artifacts and upstream / downstream dependencies. E.g., there should be no .sh, .plist, .json, .log, .png, =1.3, 3.9 files in the repo base folder ./ All files should be placed in appropriate semantically grouped and purposed locations. within the newly organized folders, identify redundancies and duplications across the entire repo and refactor while verbatim preserving all existing features but without duplications. Execute `pwd && ls && t` command to examine the currrent state of the hierarchies. Harness pattern-driven clean OO architecture DRY-modular re-usable. Use the latest python version venv and create a requirements.txt comprehensively covering all needed pip modules, preferrably not confined to particular versions so the latest ones are always pulled in that are available in that venv for the python version so better not to include versions in requirements.txt, and also update the .gitignore in case something is missing there too. Current tree:
